# Pancake Timer #

A little helper for the perfect pancakes.

### To build ###
The project uses CMake to configure the build. 
I prefer to use Ninja to build.
```
cd pancaketimer-cpp
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../ -GNinja
ninja
```

### To run ###
Run the `pancaketimer` executable inside the `build` directory.
